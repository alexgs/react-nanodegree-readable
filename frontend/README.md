# Readable

The **Readable** front-end can be installed by running `npm install`. The development server is started with `npm start`.

The [API server](../api-server/README.md) should be running on localhost, as well.

If the API server is not running when the front-end development server is started, simply start the API server. Then refresh the browser to reload the front-end.

The front-end implements all the features and functionality specified in [the rubric][1].
